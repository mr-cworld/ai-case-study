## **CNC Machining and AI: Walter Grinding**

## Overview and Origin

* I was interested in seeing how durable good manufacturers were adapting with new AI technology so I went with a premium supplier, Walter Grinder, a CNC Machinery producer. They were incorporated in 1919 founded by Richard Walter and now are part of a larger manufacturing group United Grinding Group. I decided to choose this company because I have worked with these machines personally and know that they have a lot of higher end features for CNC machinery and am curious how they are innovating in the new age of AI. Company funding wasn't directly available on their website but they are part of a larger conglomberate United Grinding Group

## Business Activities

* Walter Grinder solves the need of precision and efficiecy in CNC machining processes for a variety of applications. Typically, Metal manufacturing. They sell B2B to other manufacturers. This could include Automotive, Medical, Aerospace, and 2nd tier suppliers in these industries. Hard to calculate but definitely a global business. 

* In terms of a competitive advantage - what they can offer that others cannot, relys on their ecosystem moat similar to Apple's concept. They have a lot of patents in the space for actual machinery, have their own computer system as well as other peripherial software to accompany their machines. Another advantage is their length of time in the field that gives them a network effect from manufacturing plants already utilizing their previous generations of machines. 

* The technologies they are currently using are similar to the Internet of Things (IoT) era of technology, with the machines being able to join local networks, retreive files, and understand CAD files and put them into CAM instructions to complete jobs. Additionally things like matienance, temperature and speed data is able to be fed from the machine back to central servers so that the management of a factory can know whats going on with their machinery. Currently it seems that they and the entire CNC machinery field is still behind in terms of implementing AI or any sort of machine learning. 

## Landscape

* Walter Grinding is in the B2B Manufacturing industry. 

* The most recent trend for machinery is the IoT connection that allows information to be sent to and sent from the machines.

* From a competitor stand point there are a ton of companies in this space including Maztak, Haas, Okuma, and Makino. I'll be going to IMTS 2024 in Chicago in a few weeks to see what the latest and greatest is in the field and will be very curious to see exactly what they are doing for the future. All of these companies offer the same machine types (5-axis, lathe, precision grinding, inspection machines), similar to a Toyota and Honda situation - with operator preference and history with the brand being very important for future purchases.

## Results

* Being a little more broadstroke, the most immediate impact to manufacturing from AI pertains the CAD, or computer assisted design, aspects of manufacturing. Think photoshop for manufacturers. AI is able to take a design print from engineers and create that into a usable file for machines to be able to interpret and create. Currently this is an expensive and moderately long process for companies to undertake, having AI assist in this creation lowers the bar and allows faster turnaround times when creating new products with customers. 

*For machine Manufacturers, the most important factors are:
*    1. Machine Uptime - how reliable it is and how quickly it can go from one part to the next
*    2. Tool time - how quickly and precisely can the machine run? If your spindle can spin 100rpm faster it is then possible to cut faster and complete more parts per hour
*    3. Precision - some manufacturing has tolerance within 1 micron, or 1/100th of a human hair, machines that can hold these strict tolerances are sought after by top manufacturers in the medical or aerospace fields.

* Relative to competitors in the field, I would say that Walter Grinding is doing well. They have stayed even with the market offerings and are positioned with IoT enabled machines for future advancements. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would advise them to lean more into AI! having a machine be able to know what its doing and be able to think of things it could be doing better (like running the spindle faster) could be huge for increasing value of their machine relative to competitors. Also being able to diagnose whats going wrong when making a part at the machine level would be great for inexpereinced or overworked machinests who are running mulitple jobs at the same time.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
In the future America will need technologial solutions to stay competitive in the Manufacturing world vs China and other developing nations.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? They would use embedded devices that can run AI at the local level, im not sure a LLM or generative AI would be relevant for this applications. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? These technologies are appropriate because the next generation of manufacturing will be an AI lead generation and Walter Grinder will need to have these features to continue to sell machinery.

# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: I went with Walter Grinder, a CNC machinery producer.

* When was the company incorporated? 1919 

* Who are the founders of the company? Richard Walter

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? I am familiar with their machines and was curious to see how AI is impacting machinery/embedded systems today. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? Unclear but it has been around over 100 years and is a company that is part of a larger congolomerate United Grinding Group

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? They solve the need of precision and efficiecy in CNC machining processes for a variety of applications. Typically, Metal manufacturing. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? They sell B2B to other manufacturers. This could include Automotive, Medical, Aerospace, and 2nd tier suppliers in these industries. Hard to calculate but definitely a global business. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) They have a lot of patents in the space for actual machinery, have their own computer system as well as other peripherial software to accompany their machines. Another advantage is their length of tiem in the field that gives them a network effect from manufacturing plants already utilizing their previous generations of machines. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? The technologies they are currently using are similar to the Internet of Things (IoT) era of technology, with the machines being able to join local networks, retreive files, and understand CAD files and put them into CAM instructions to complete jobs. Additionally things like matienance, temperature and speed data is able to be fed from the machine back to central servers so that the management of a factory can know whats going on with their machinery. Currently it seems that they and the entire CNC machinery field is still behind in terms of implementing AI or any sort of machine learning. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? B2B Manufacturing

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 10 years? As said above the most recent trend for machinery is the IoT connection that allows information to be sent to and sent from the machines.

* What are the other major companies in this field? There are a ton of companies in this space including Maztak, Haas, Okuma, and Makino. I'll be going to IMTS 2024 in Chicago in a few weeks to see what the latest and greatest is in the field and will be very curious to see exactly what they are doing for the future. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Being a little more broadstroke, the most immediate impact to manufacturing from AI pertains the CAD, or computer assisted design, aspects of manufacturing. Think photoshop for manufacturers. AI is able to take a design print from engineers and create that into a usable file for machines to be able to interpret and create.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? 
For machine Manufacturers, the most important factors are:
    1. Machine Uptime - how reliable it is and how quickly it can go from one part to the next
    2. Tool time - how quickly and precisely can the machine run? If your spindle can spin 100rpm faster it is then possible to cut faster and complete more parts per hour
    3. Precision - some manufacturing has tolerance within 1 micron, or 1/100th of a human hair, machines that can hold these strict tolerances are sought after by top manufacturers in the medical or aerospace fields.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? Overall I would say they are doing well, It is competitive relative to other manufacturers listed above. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would advise them to lean more into AI! having a machine be able to know what its doing and be able to think of things it could be doing better (like running the spindle faster) could be huge for increasing value of their machine relative to competitors. Also being able to diagnose whats going wrong when making a part at the machine level would be great for inexpereinced or overworked machinests who are running mulitple jobs at the same time.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
In the future America will need technologial solutions to stay competitive in the Manufacturing world vs China and other developing nations.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? They would use embedded devices that can run AI at the local level, im not sure a LLM or generative AI would be relevant for this applications. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? These technologies are appropriate because the next generation of manufacturing will be an AI lead generation and Walter Grinder will need to have these features to continue to sell machinery.
